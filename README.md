# CPS406-CivilReport-Map

In the document, the website was designed as having a page for reporting problems, a page for updating a problem's status by civil servants, and a database that keeps track of all the reported problems.The webpage access was divided for two types of users: users that report problems and civil servant users that can change a problem's status and have a login and password. The user would select a problem type from a dropdown menu and have the option of providing comments and an email address to receive updates. To prevent duplicate entries, only one type of problem is allowed within a certain radius, to be determined by the civil servant users.The civil servants have access to a problem's details and update a problem's status, including verifying the problem.  Once a problem is reported, it is up to the civil servants to send someone to verify the problem and update the problem's status in the database of the website. Every time a problem's status is updated, emails are sent to those prople who chose to leave their emails to be updated on the problem's status. Once the problem is verified to be false or is verified and fixed, it is removed from the databas
